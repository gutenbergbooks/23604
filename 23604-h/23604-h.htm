<h3>ADVICE TO A YOUNG PARTY SCRIBE.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">You</span> may, an it please you, be dull,</p>
<p class="i2">(For Britons deem dulness "respectable");</p>
<p>Stale flowers of speech you may cull,</p>
<p class="i2">With meanings now scarcely detectable;</p>
<p>You may wallow in saturnine spite,</p>
<p class="i2">You may flounder in flatulent flummery;</p>
<p>Be sombre as poet <span class="sc">Young's</span> "<i>Night</i>,"</p>
<p class="i2">And dry as a Newspaper "Summary";</p>
<p>As rude as a yowling Yahoo,</p>
<p class="i2">As chill as a volume of <span class="sc">Chitty</span>;</p>
<p>But oh, Sir, whatever you do,</p>
<p class="i2">You must <i>not</i> be witty!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Plod on through the sand-wastes of Fact,</p>
<p>Long level of gritty aridity;</p>
<p class="i2">With pompous conceit make a pact,</p>
<p>Be bondsman to bald insipidity;</p>
<p class="i2">Be slab as a black Irish bog,</p>
<p>Slow, somnolent, stupid, and stodgy;</p>
<p class="i2">Plunge into sophistical fog,</p>
<p>And the realms of the dumpishly dodgy.</p>
<p class="i2">With trump elephantine and slow,</p>
<p>Tread on through word-swamps, dank and darkling;</p>
<p class="i2">But no, most decidedly <i>no</i>,</p>
<p>You must <i>not</i> be sparkling!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Be just as unjust as you like,</p>
<p class="i2">A conscienceless, 'cute special-pleader;</p>
<p>As spiteful as <i>Squeers</i> was to <i>Smike</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">(You may often trace <i>Squeers</i> in a "leader.")</p>
<p>Impute all the vileness you can,</p>
<p class="i2">Poison truth with snake-venom of fable,</p>
<p>Be fair&mdash;as is woman to man,</p>
<p class="i2">And kindly&mdash;as <span class="sc">Cain</span> was to <span class="sc">Abel</span>.</p>
<p>Suggest what is false in a sneer,</p>
<p class="i2">Suppress what is true by confusing;</p>
<p>Be sour, stale, and flat as small-beer,</p>
<p class="i2">But <i>don't</i> be amusing!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Party zealots will pardon your spite,</p>
<p class="i2">If against their opponents it sputters,</p>
<p>The way a (word) foeman to fight,</p>
<p class="i2">Is to misrepresent all he utters.</p>
<p>That does not need wisdom or wit,</p>
<p class="i2">(Ye poor party-scribes, what a blessing!)</p>
<p>No clean knightly sword, but a spit</p>
<p class="i2">Is the weapon for mangling and messing;</p>
<p>Wield that, like a cudgel-armed rough</p>
<p class="i2">Blent with ruthless bravo,&mdash;such are numerous!&mdash;</p>
<p>Lie, slander, spout pitiful stuff,</p>
<p class="i2">But&mdash;beware of the humorous!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>For if you should fall into fun,</p>
<p class="i2">You might lapse into manly good-nature,</p>
<p>And then&mdash;well <i>your</i> course would be run!</p>
<p class="i2">No,&mdash;study up spleen's nomenclature;</p>
<p>Learn all the mad logic of hate,</p>
<p class="i2">And then, though your style be like skilly,</p>
<p>Your sense frothy Styx in full spate.</p>
<p class="i2">And your maxims portentously silly;</p>
<p>You will find party scope for your pen,</p>
<p class="i2">Coin meanness and malice to money;</p>
<p><i>But</i> sour dulness must keep to his den,</p>
<p class="i2">And <i>never</i> be funny.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE GUINEA-PIGS.</h2>

<h4><i>(A Financial Fable.)</i></h4>

<blockquote><p>
["There are dozens of Companies now existing
with the Duke of <span class="sc">Puffball</span>, Sir <span class="sc">Bonus Bare-acres</span>,
Bart., Major <span class="sc">Guinea Pig</span>, M.P., and
the like, figuring upon the Board of Directors.
A short, but drastic Act, making all such figureheads
directly responsible, would go far to prevent
similar occurrences, and to abolish a delusive, if
not a fraudulent system."&mdash;<i>Herbert T. Reid's
Letter to the Times</i>.]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Smart</span> Mr. <span class="sc">Fox</span>, whose brain no conscience troubles,</p>
<p>Floated a Company&mdash;for blowing bubbles!</p>
<p>"Bubbles?" the duller creatures cried in chorus,</p>
<p>"Are you not coming nursery nonsense o'er us?</p>
<p>What is the use of bubbles&mdash;save to boys?"</p>
<p>"Hush!" cried 'cute Reynard. "Do not make a noise!</p>
<p>Bubbles&mdash;if bright&mdash;are cunning's best decoys.</p>
<p>Bubbles are only wind plus soap and water;</p>
<p>But well-stirred suds, and well-blown flatulence,</p>
<p>In this fool world, have influence immense,</p>
<p>And draw unthinking dupes from every quarter.</p>
<p>Eloquence is but Wind, yet flowery trope</p>
<p class="i8">Is Humbug's favourite lure;</p>
<p>And what is Diplomatic Skill but soap?</p>
<p class="i8">Trust me! Success is sure!</p>
<p>Bubbles are bright, bewitch the mob, float far,</p>
<p class="i8">And cost the blower little.</p>
<p>The watery sphere <i>looks</i> like a world, a star,</p>
<p>And when it bursts, being exceeding brittle,</p>
<p>Where it explodes (as at the rainbow's foot)</p>
<p>There's hidden treasure&mdash;for the clever brute</p>
<p>Who knows that gulls are the great wealth-bestowers,</p>
<p>Bubbles mean solid bullion&mdash;for the blowers!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The shrewder animals applauded. Lupus</p>
<p>Cried, "We are with you, so you do not dupe us!"</p>
<p>Ursus and Taurus also, Bull and Bear,</p>
<p>Were eager in the game to take a share.</p>
<p>Said Vulpus to the assembled quadrupeds,</p>
<p>"Company Boards, like ships, need figureheads,</p>
<p>Wooden but ornamental! Eh? You twig?</p>
<p>Sweet are the uses of&mdash;the Guinea Pig!</p>
<p>Dull, but respectable and decorative,</p>
<p>That tribe, to whom credulity is native.</p>
<p>They'll sit around our Board in solemn row,</p>
<p>And never, never  'want to know, you know,'</p>
<p>Beyond convenient limits.  Their proud presence</p>
<p>Will fill our flock with faith; their acquiescence,</p>
<p>So readily secured by liberal fees,</p>
<p>Will make the mob accept our schemes with ease.</p>
<p>Behold them! They will give us little trouble</p>
<p>By wanting&mdash;well, to analyse the Bubble;</p>
<p>So they get something for themselves more solid,</p>
<p class="i8">They'll sit serene and stolid</p>
<p>In titled sloth and coronetted slumber.</p>
<p>I can secure them, friends, in any number;</p>
<p>For Guinea Pigs are numerous and prolific</p>
<p>And as decoys their influence is mirific.</p>
<p>So whilst we work our Bubble-blowing rigs,</p>
<p class="i8">Hurrah, for Guinea Pigs!</p>
<p>They'll take our fees, assent to our suggestions,</p>
<p>And ask no awkward questions."</p>

<h3>THE POOR MAN AND HIS BEER.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
[Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>, at Birmingham, said, "We
know that the Government propose to deprive the
working classes of their beer." ("<i>Shame!</i>" <i>and a
Voice</i>, "<i>They don't!</i>")
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"<span class="sc">Rob</span> the poor Workman of his glass of beer!!!"</p>
<p>And can that clap-trap, then, still raise a cheer?</p>
<p>The British Workman has a thirsty throat,</p>
<p>The British Workman also has a Vote,</p>
<p>One will protect the other&mdash;if it cares to.</p>
<p>But if he'd close, by vote, the shops such snares to</p>
<p>His tipple-tempted and intemperate throttle</p>
<p>He robs <i>himself</i> of access to the bottle,&mdash;</p>
<p>If robbery it's called&mdash;'tis not another,</p>
<p>(Who is a swell, with cellars) his poor brother</p>
<p>Deprives of that long-hackneyed, much-mouthed "glass."</p>
<p>The British Workman is not quite an ass,</p>
<p>And where he wants to whet (with beer) his throat,</p>
<p>Where are you like to get your two-thirds Vote?</p>
<p>Whether there's wisdom in this vaunted Veto,</p>
<p>Is quite another question sense must see to.</p>
<p>And general justice judge. But those who cheer</p>
<p>The stale old fudge about the Poor Man's Beer,</p>
<p>Should learn it is a dodge of vested pelf,</p>
<p>And, rich or poor, a man can't rob himself.</p>
<p>It is the poor who suffer from temptation,</p>
<p>And drink's detestable adulteration,</p>
<p>That crying ill which no one dares to tackle!</p>
<p>Whilst Witlers howl, and Water-zealots cackle.</p>
<p>The poor are poisoned, not by honest drink,</p>
<p>But lethal stuff that might scour out a sink.</p>
<p>The Poor Man's Beer, quotha! Who'll keep it <i>pure?</i></p>
<p>Not rich monopolists, nor prigs demure,</p>
<p>Those shriek for freedom, these for prohibition,</p>
<p>"Vend the drugged stuff sans scrutiny or condition!"</p>
<p>Cries Vested Interest. "Close, by law or Vote,</p>
<p>The Witler's tavern and the Workman's throat!"</p>
<p>Shouts the fanatic. Which, then, fad or pelf,</p>
<p>Cares really, solely, for the Poor Man's self?</p>
<p>Nay; the Monopolist fights for his money,</p>
<p>The Monomaniac for his craze. How funny</p>
<p>To hear one shout for <i>freedom</i>, t'other cheer</p>
<p>The poisoner's cant about the Poor Man's Beer!</p>

he went to Larne.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p>Statesmen, Historians, and such, may think
that, between the years 1871 and 1876, "the
Egyptian Question" turned upon the extravagance
of <span class="sc">Ismail Pasha</span>, and the financial
complications that followed thereupon.
Readers of the <i>Recollections of an Egyptian
Princess</i> (<span class="sc">Blackwood</span>) will know better.
The real Egyptian Question of that epoch
was, whether the English Governess of the
Khedive's daughter should get her mistress's
carriage at the very hour she wanted it;
whether she should have the
best rooms in any palace or
hotel she might chance to be
located in; and whether she
should have her meals served
at the time and in the fashion
she had been accustomed to
in the family mansion at
Clapton or Camberwell.
Many stirring passages in
the book deal with these and
cognate matters. None delights
my Baronite more
than one in which a driver
named <span class="sc">Hassan</span> figures.
<span class="sc">Hassan</span>, ordered for eight
o'clock, sometimes came at
nine. Occasionally at six.
"He asked for 'backseesh,'
which" Miss <span class="sc">Chennells</span>
writes, "I did not consider
myself bound to give, as he
never did anything for me."
On two occasions, her heart
warming, she coyly pressed
a florin into his hand, with
dire results. "He was," she
records, "much worse after
it" (the florin, which he
seems to have taken neat),
"and would, when driving,
stoop down, and look through
the front window of the
brougham, shouting 'Backseesh!'"
However, Miss
<span class="sc">Chennells</span> got even with
<span class="sc">Hassan</span>. She followed her
usual course when things
went ill. She complained to
her pupil, the Princess.
Next morning, when the
unsuspecting <span class="sc">Hassan</span> drove
into the court-yard, "he was
told by the Eunuchs to descend
from the box, was conducted
to an inner receptacle,
and," Miss <span class="sc">Chennells</span>
grimly adds, "then and
there bastinadoed." Incidentally,
in connection with
the English Governess's
struggle for supremacy in
the City of the Pharaohs, we
get pictures of life in the
Harem, and glimpses of the
lavish magnificence of the
Khedieval Court, with its
French embroidery on
Eastern robes. It was with the object of
describing these scenes, viewed from a rare
vantage point, that the story was written.
But not the least interesting character is that,
unconsciously drawn, of the prim, practical,
precise English Governess, pushing her way
through the crowd of courtiers and Ethiopian
slaves, peering through gold-rimmed eyeglasses
into the recesses of the Harem, and
glaring angrily at the hapless Eunuchs,
who, going their morning rounds, visit her
bedroom, regardless of the twine with which,
before entering on her virgin slumbers,
she had sedulously fastened the lockless
door. Altogether a delightful book, says
<span class="sc">Passim Pasha</span>, the accredited representative
of the Baron <span class="sc">De Book-worms</span>.</p>

<p>Those who like "Just a tale by twilight,
When the lights are low, And the
glittering shadows Softly come and go," will
do well to expend the comparatively small

being the only one that ends, as
all otherwise purposeless tales should end,
happily. The Stories are grim enough, in all
conscience, but they are told in a hearty sort
of fashion, which, while relieving them of
some of their weirdness, is calculated to
impress the reader with an idea of the honesty
and <i>bona fides</i> of the narrator. Thus far,</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR A CRIMINAL COLLEGE.</h3>

<p>(<i>Suitable for Use at the Prison University, Elmira.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is a crime?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> A discovered breach of the law.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And a virtue?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Its antithesis&mdash;the same thing unsuspected.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What should be the chief occupation of
a criminal?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A serious study of the law, with a
view to its successful evasion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there a law for the
rich and a law for the poor?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; but a
well-feed Q.C. is more than
a match for a briefless Counsel
whose professional sustenance
is "soup."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is now generally
considered to be the highest
line of crime?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The malpractice that
is frequently inseparable
from holding of important
positions on the Boards of
bogus public Companies.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is necessary to
secure a livelihood out of
burglary?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A clear head, a knowledge
of chemistry and kindred
subjects, and a fair
amount of capital.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why is ready money
necessary?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because the calling of
a burglar nowadays is attended
by various compulsory
expenses. A successful
burglar should be able
to purchase skeleton-keys
and "jemmies" of the most
exquisite and delicate quality.
Moreover, he should be
able to entertain largely,
and to keep a yacht.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is swindling ever
known to be legal?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Scarcely; still it can
often be practised with impunity
on the Stock Exchange
and the Turf.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is petty larceny lawful?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only when practised on
the belongings of your wife,
and even in this case it is
well to keep her in ignorance
of the provisions of the
Married Woman's Property
Act.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the advantages
of a sojourn in the
newly organised Elmira
establishment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An inmate is taught a
trade, or even a profession.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And now, in conclusion,
considering that a breach of the
law is necessary to secure admission to the
University, what would you consider the most
appropriate motto for the Institution?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> "Honesty is not (at first) the best
policy."</p>

<h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

<h4>No. XVIII.&mdash;TO FAILURE.</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Hitherto, I seem to have been submitting to you examples
that cannot properly be described as failures. This was not my purpose.
I wished rather to describe one or two characters whose ruin,
to a greater or smaller degree, you have compassed by your influence.
But some sprite seemed to take possession of my pen; my efforts were
unsuccessful, and I was led away from my original purpose. Perhaps
that is one of the penalties of addressing you. We shall see!
In any case let me proceed with my task as best I may.</p>

<p>It happened to me once&mdash;the date is immaterial&mdash;that after a considerable
absence, I returned to London. You know, perhaps, how
it fares with those who, for any length of time, become exiles from
their native land. All the institutions, the small no less than the
great, that go to make up our varied social life at home, become
glorified as it were, and loom larger through the mist of absence.
They become part and parcel of a traveller's patriotism, even if in
his home-life he took no part in them. I was due to return at the
end of May, in time for the Derby-day. I
am not a racing-man. I had never seen the
Derby run, chiefly, I fancy, because I had
never had any desire to see it. But I remember
that amongst my brother-exiles, I
was being eternally congratulated on the
good luck that took me home in time for
this great national event. "What, you
are going to be back by the end of May,"
one of them would say; "why you'll be
able to go to the Derby?" So that in time,
I came to accept this possibility as a specially
enviable feature of my home-coming.
From that, to making up my mind to go to
the Derby was but a step, I took it, and
on the great day I made one of the mighty
crowd on Epsom Downs. I don't remember
much about the race. I met many friends
who asked me, as is common in such cases,
if I was back already; a question to which
it seems difficult to find a suitable reply, if
one's bodily presence is not to be accepted
as a sufficient evidence of the fact. Many
others volunteered to put me on to various
absolute certainties, and one man chilled
my newly-born racing-patriotism by observing,
that he would as soon have thought
of seeing <span class="sc">Fred Archer</span> at a meeting of the
British Association.</p>

<p>I don't mean to describe the scene on the
Downs. One crowd is much like another;
and, when you have said something of the
proverbial good-nature of a British crowd,
you have done all that can be justly required
of you, after seeing a hunted wretch all
but torn in pieces by a mob of blackguards
worse than himself. However, I think I
enjoyed myself well enough. Others enjoyed
themselves more, and amongst these
was a party of roystering, jovial fellows,
who ate a hearty luncheon, and drank much
champagne, on the top of a hired drag.
One of them particularly attracted my attention. Somewhere, I knew,
I had seen that curious, clean-shaved, bull-frog face before. It was
perfectly familiar to me, but, for the life of me, I couldn't recall the
circumstances in which I had previously set eyes on it. He appeared
to be the leader of the revels, and kept his companions in fits of
laughter at his sallies. I beat my brains to remember him, but
all in vain. All that I could arrive at was a sense of incongruity,
an impression of the unexpected in the spectacle I had witnessed.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to the "Frivolity," to see the latest rays
of the lamp of burlesque. That scene, at any rate, was familiar.
There, in all their spotless panoply of expressionless face, and irreproachable
shirt-front, sat the golden lads of the Metropolis in
their rows, images of bored stupidity, stiffly cased in black and
white. There too, were to be seen the snowy shoulders and the
sparkling jewels of the ladies both of the smart and of the higher
half world, with here and there an extensive dowager to add
weight and decorum to the throng. The curtain drew up on one
of the usual scenes of rejoicing. Shapely ladies, in tights, chorused
their delight at the approaching nuptials of a great lord's daughter.
Then the contented peasantry of the surrounding district stepped
forward to swell the joyful strains, and to be regaled with draughts
of sparkling emptiness from the inexhaustible beaker wielded by
the landlord of the neighbouring inn. And there, under the broad
hat of one of these rejoicing peasants, I recognised the bull-frog face
that had puzzled me that day at Epsom. In a flash I remembered
him and all the scenes in which he had played a humble part. Far
back from the dimness of some of my earliest theatrical experiences,
up to the present moment, I followed him on his career, simulating
joint merriment, bearing one of many banners, carrying a pike
or a halberd in an army similarly armed, conspiring in a mantle,
draining a brimming goblet, but never&mdash;at least within my recollection&mdash;taking
a part of any individuality, or one that gave him a chance
of singing or speaking a single line by himself. He had been one of the
ruck when I had first seen him, and now, after at least twenty years,
the ruck still claimed him for its own. I remember I had woven a
sort of romance about him. There, I had thought to myself, is a man
who, no doubt, began his stage career with high aspirations, and noble
ambitions. It cannot have been his aim to figure for ever merely as
one of a crowd. And I had pictured him gradually losing hope, and
wearing his heart out in the bitterness of deferred ambition as he
walked gloomily through life, with the stamp of failure on his brow.
The picture was a pathetic one, you must admit, worthy to take its
place on the line with the well-known fancy sketch of the Clown
who, after making the masses split their sides, goes home to a
private life of penury and despair.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:300px;"><a href="images/173-800.png"><img src="images/173-246.png" width="246" height="450" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>Well, that day I had seen a piece of my
friend's private life at Epsom. Nothing
could have been farther removed from
misery. A light-hearted gaiety reigned in
his face and ruled his every gesture. His
companions seemed to bow to him, as to
their leading humorist and mirth-maker. I
was stimulated by the collapse of my elaborate
illusion to make inquiries about him.
I found that he had been born almost on
the stage, and had taken part in stage-life
from his earliest years. He never had any
ambition: so long as he could be on the
stage, and take part in its life, his desires
were satisfied. He lived an absolutely contented
life, smoked infamous tobacco out
of clay-pipes, and was in high repute
amongst his intimates as a singer of jovial
songs, and a teller of brisk theatrical anecdotes.
There was not a spark of envy in his
nature. He honoured the great actors, and
was always ready to do all he could to
smooth the path of any nervous youngster
with excellent advice and cheerful help.
He is still acting. Anybody who wishes
can see him on any night, helping to troll
forth the chorus of a song of Mexican
warriors in the great spectacular drama of
<i>Montezuma</i>. There is no more perfectly-satisfied
being in existence. On that I am
prepared to stake my life. Let this tale
then be a warning to those who are over-hasty
to construct romances of pathetic
contrast on an insufficient foundation. One
hugs such stories to one's heart, and it is
something of a wrench to have to give them
up in the light of a fuller knowledge.</p>

<p>And here I am, having all but reached
the limits of my appointed space, without
apparently having gone one step nearer to
the fulfilment of the task on which I set
out. I can only ask you to take the will for the deed in the meantime.
And after all, if this unambitious actor had only been what
I imagined him to be, I could not have produced an apter example.
But he had the impertinence to live his life in his own way, and
that did not happen to accord with the theories I had been led to
form about it. Shall I never be able to come to the point? I have
not yet given up all hope?</p>

<p>Yours as usual,</p>

<h2>A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragments of a Discourse, delivered under the similitude of a Dream,
but of symbolic and purely secular significance.</i>)</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, at the end of this Valley of Obstruction was another, called
the Valley of the Shadow of Disunion; and the Pilgrim must needs
go through it, because the way to the Plain of Progress and the
Pinnacle of Passage lay through the midst of it.</p>

<p>Now this Valley is a very perilous place,&mdash;a place where none care
to dwell, and which few attain to pass through. And here the Pilgrim
was worse put to it than in his previous encounter with the Apollyon
of Obstruction.</p>

<p>I saw then in my dream that when the Pilgrim was got to the
borders of the Shadow of Disunion, there met him certain men,
aforetime his fellow-travellers, making haste to go back; to whom
the Pilgrim spake as follows:&mdash;-</p>

<p><i>Pilgrim.</i> Whither are you going?</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Back again! And we would have you do so too, if either
life, peace, or honour is prized by you.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrim.</i> Why, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Matter? We were going that way as you are going, and
went as far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past coming
back.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrim.</i> But what have you met with?</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Why, we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Disunion,
where abide Disruption, Dishonour, and Disaster, but that,
by good hap, keeping a <span class="sc">Bright</span> look-out, we looked before us, and
saw the danger ere we came to it.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrim.</i> But what have you seen?</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Seen? Why the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch;
we also saw there the hobgoblins, bogies, and dragons of the pit; we
also heard in that Valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a
people under unutterable misery, who there sat bound in affliction
and chains; and over that Valley hang the discouraging clouds of
Confusion; Discord, also, doth always spread its wings over it. In
a word, it is every whit dreadful, being utterly without Law and
Order.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrim.</i> Nevertheless I perceive not yet, by what you have said,
but that this is my way to the desired haven.</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Be it thy way&mdash;we will not choose it for ours!</p>

<p>So they parted, and the Pilgrim went on his way, but still with
his sword drawn in his hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.</p>

<hr />
<div class="figright" style="width:500px;"><a href="images/175-1400.png"><img src="images/175-354.png" width="354" height="450" alt="A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS." /></a>
<h3>A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS.</h3></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
<p>I saw then in my dream, as far as this Valley reached, there was
on the right hand a very deep ditch, that, to wit, dismally known to
some as the Last Ditch, whereinto the blind have oftentimes urged
the blind, even threatening therein to plunge and perish, rather than
acknowledge certain things which subsequently they nevertheless
proceeded pretty peaceably to accept. Again, behold, on the left
hand, there was a very dangerous quag or bog, into which if even a
good, or grand, man falls, he finds no bottom for his foot to stand on.</p>

<p>The pathway was here also exceedingly narrow, and therefore the
Pilgrim was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the dark, to
shun the ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over into the bog
on the other; also, when he sought to escape the bog, without great
carefulness, he would be ready to fall into the ditch. Thus he
went on, and I heard him sigh bitterly, for, besides the dangers
mentioned above, the pathway was here so dark that ofttimes, when
he lifted up his foot to go forward, he knew not where or upon what
he should set it next.</p>

<p>"Now," thought the Pilgrim, "what shall I do?" And ever and
anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance,
with sparks and hideous noises (things that cared not for the
Pilgrim's sword) that he was forced to put up his blade, and betake
himself to another weapon called Tactics. Thus he went on a good
while, yet still the flames would be reaching towards him; also, he
heard doleful voices, and rushings to and fro, so that sometimes he
thought he should be torn in pieces, or trodden down like mire in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
streets. This frightful sight was seen, and these direful noises were
heard by him for a long while together; and coming to a place
where he thought he heard a great company of fierce opponents (as
it were a numerous and influential Deputation, or a prodigious
Procession) coming forward to meet him, he stopped, and began to
muse what he had best to do. Sometimes he had half a thought to
go back; then again he thought he might be half-way through the
Valley. He remembered, also, how he had already vanquished
many a danger, and that the peril of going back might be much
more than to go forward. So he resolved to go on; yet the bogies,
hobgoblins, and dragons of the pit seemed to come nearer and
nearer, besetting him with boding warnings, angry expostulations,
and menacing outcries from both sides of his strait and perilous
pathway, as well from the bog that was on the one hand, as from the
ditch that was on the other.</p>

<hr />

<p>And here, as it seemed, my Dream did lapse and intermit, and I
lost sight, for a while, of the Pilgrim and his perils, much musing
whether he, though verily valiant and of manifest good will, were
wise in making this dangerous adventure, or at all like to fare safely
through and escape the ditch, the bog, the darkness, and the
demoniac denizens of this dismal Valley of the Shadow of Disunion.</p>

<h2>OPERA DRURIOLANA.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:300px;"><a href="images/177a.png"><img src="images/177a-271.png" width="271" height="450" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>May success attend the preliminary Operatic canter which Sir
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> is taking with such preliminary cantors as he has got
together at Drury Lane. <i>Faust</i> was effectively given, with <span class="sc">Esther
Palliser</span> as a gentle <i>Marguerite</i>, Signor <span class="sc">Giannini</span> as a very
robust
<i>Faust</i>&mdash;quite a <i>tenore robusto</i>&mdash;and Signor <span class="sc">Castelmary</span> as
the very
deuce of a <i>Mephistopheles</i>, with eyebrows and moustachios sufficient
to frighten even the gay and festive <i>Marta</i>,
played with spirit by Mlle. <span class="sc">Biancoli</span>.
"Mons." <span class="sc">Dufriche</span> represented the <i>Mons</i>
who laboured hard to please, and who, as
<i>Valentine</i>, did well and died well. Herr
<span class="sc">Feld</span> conducted. "Well Felded!"</p>

<p>Then out came the ever fresh, the ever free
<i>Bohemian Girl</i>. Never was such a girl!
Quite a <span class="sc">Ninon de L'Enclos</span>! Beautiful for
ever! Still dreaming of Marble Halls (Music
Halls nowadays) "with vassals and serfs by
her si-i-ide," and no better Bohemian Girl
to be seen just now than Madame <span class="sc">Albu</span> as
<i>Arline</i>. So "Arl in to begin!" and see and
hear <span class="sc">Balfe's</span> pretty little Girl of Bohemia
while she is still visible and audible at Drury
Lane. Mr. <span class="sc">Eadie</span> a trifle gawky as <i>Thaddeus</i>,
but then he finds himself in an awkward
situation, especially when he has to fumble for the documentary
evidence of his birth, attested at a Bohemian Registry Office. <span class="sc">Carl
Armbruster</span> conducted this, and then up got Herr <span class="sc">Feld</span> "with his
little lot," represented by the unrivalled and unequalled <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i>. Ah! <i>Cavalleria</i> is a treat, even when its performance
is not absolutely perfect. The music is charming from first to last;
ever fresh and delightful.</p>

<p>That wonderful <i>Intermezzo</i> was excellently given, and enthusiastically
encored. As yet the <i>Intermezzo</i> has had no successful rival.
It stands alone, and is, of all compositions, the most&mdash;well, words
fail me&mdash;it is a whole dramatic story, within a few bars' compass&mdash;it
is sweetness and sadness, and then it soothes you to rest, and so
you drop off quietly to sleep, until you are awoke by the cessation of
sound, when you rouse yourself, with an effort, to applaud, and to beg
that you may have just one more delicious dose of it&mdash;and doze from
it. Saturday finishes with <i>Carmen</i>, and <i>Sic transit gloria
Operatica</i>
for the past week. All right up to now!</p>

<h2>SPORTING ANSWERS.&mdash;CANINE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Spectator</span>.&mdash;A very curious and interesting little story. We
ourselves once had a dog who on returning home from a walk
always chained himself up in the back-kitchen and bit the butler.
He would then howl bitterly, slip his collar, and run to the
nearest police station, where he gave himself into custody and
insisted on cleaning out his own cell and appearing on the following
morning before the Magistrate. This shows that dogs can reason.
Our dog eventually died of being constantly quoted by Curates a
Temperance Lectures. This was disappointing, as we had never
grudged him either attention or butlers. One of our butlers had a
cork leg,&mdash;but that is another story.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sub Silentio</span>.&mdash;(1) A dog's chief value is conversational. At
afternoon teas such an animal is a wonderful resource after you have
exhausted the picture-shows, the theatres, and all the scandals.
You can lead off about his pedigree. "He's champion bred on both
sides," always sounds well. A funny man is sure to say, "Champion
bread-and-butter you mean. Ha! ha!" at the same time offering
the animal some from the tea-table, to mark his point. This may
be previously arranged, if you prefer it. Throw in a few stories
about his wonderful intelligence in distinguishing the baker's boy
from the mistress of the house, to the detriment of the former, and
wind up by narrating how he once found his way home to Piccadilly
from Pekin. All dogs do this in one way or another, so you will be
quite safe. Then everybody else contributes his own special Spectatorial
dog-story, and your tea will pass off without a dull or an
accurate moment.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i> Yes, Sir, a pretty fine lot. But I can't stand palavering or
those rowdies loafing around will pull the house about our ears. When
the Unemployed are idle, the police have enough to do! Ponder over
it, Sir; ponder over it! [<i>Curtain, and</i> Ben. Organiser <i>left

<p><span class="sc">A Vell Vorn Motto</span>.&mdash;In his sound and sensible reply to a
congratulatory address, H.E. Cardinal <span class="sc">Vaughan</span> suggested <i>"Amare
et servire"</i> as the motto for the Christian capitalist. To the first
verb the capitalist would, it is probable, make no objection; but as
to the second, he would be inclined to move as an amendment, that,
"for '<i>i</i>' in <i>servire</i> should be substituted '<i>a</i>'." At all
events,
<i>Amare et servare</i> is the narrower view taken on the broader of the
two roads in life.</p>

of "the Phenomenal Success" of <i>Walker&mdash;London</i>, it is to
be kept going throughout the season. Excellent. But, for the sake
of Mr. J. M. <span class="sc">Barrie</span>, its talented author, it is to be hoped that the
conditions of the performance of his popular play are not "fee
nominal." But for this J. L. T.&mdash;which initials stand for Jenerous

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Thursday, April 6.</i>&mdash;Met again after so-called
Easter Holidays. Mr. G. early in his place, looking as blooming as
the Spring flower in his buttonhole. "The <span class="sc">Bright 'un</span> from
Brighton," was <span class="sc">Marjoribanks's</span> way of announcing the Chief, as he
entered from behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair. Spoke for hour-and-half on
moving Second Reading of Home-Rule Bill. General impression is
everything possible been already said on subject. This conviction
so deeply impressed that Members will not come back to resume
Debate. Benches only half full whilst Mr. G. delivering what will
rank as historic speech. Situation accepted to extent that ten days
or fortnight must be given up to Second-Reading Debate. Wouldn't
be respectful, or even decent, to dispose of stage of such a measure
in less time. Well known that this Sahara of observation will not
influence single vote. If arrangements had been made with due
notice to take division to-night, after Mr. G. had urged Second
Reading of Bill, and <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span> had moved rejection, the majority
would have been exactly the same as it will be a fortnight hence,
when end is reached after multitudinous talk. Not by a vote more,
nor a vote less, will Government majority be varied. Still, usual
thing to talk for week or fortnight upon Bill of this kind. House
will not fail in its duty to <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country. A dolorous
prospect, judging from to-night's experience. Mr. G. kept audience
well together. Members increased as he spoke; but when <span class="sc">St.
Michael</span> rose, audience dispersed like leaves in wintry weather.</p>

<p>"An excellent fellow <span class="sc">Beach</span>," said <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>,
"But in his House of Commons speech always gives one the idea
that, through a blameless existence, he has been rolled upon by the
melancholy ocean."</p>

<h3>"THE UPPER G."</h3>

<div class="poem1a">  <div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the fair land of Poland</p>
<p class="i2">Was ploughed by the hoof</p>

<p class="i2">The down-trodden serfs</p>
<p class="i2">With small hope and no 'oof'</p>
<p>Demanded a great Home-Rule Bill!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

</div><br /><br />

<p>Certainly his speech has depressing effect. Members, with one
consent, go out to think over what he is probably going to say.
Convenient arrangement
for them, but does
not add to hilarity of
proceedings, or vary impression
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman's</span>
figure of
speech conveys.</p>

<p>After <span class="sc">Beach, Birrell</span>,
with a new chapter
of <i>Obiter Dicta</i>.
Some of the smartest
things addressed to the
empty seat where <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
should have
been on view. But <span class="sc">Joseph</span>
not yet come up
out of Egypt. Had he
been here, and House a
little fuller, the new
chapter would have gone
off capitally. As things
turned out, there was a
fatal unreality in situation,
which House quick
to realise. Pretty to see
Members, as <span class="sc">Birrell</span>
struggled with his notes,
involuntarily sniffing, as
if they recognised familiar
whiff of midnight
lamp.</p>

<p>"Worst of these impromptus prepared beforehand," said <span class="sc">St. John
Brodrick</span>, himself a master of spontaneous speech, "is, you
never know in what circumstances they may have to be delivered."</p>

<p>Towards midnight, some refreshment in the incursion of <span class="sc">Swift
Macneill</span>. Came up smiling; handing himself round, as it were,
for inspection, as sample of kind of persecution of Protestants that
would follow in Ulster on enactment of Home-Rule Bill. "I'm a
Protestant, Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>," he shouted, beaming on the Chair, "and
I'm sent here by a majority of 2,500 Catholic peasants to represent
an Ulster Constituency."</p>

<h4>The Hattitude of Dr. Tanner, Thursday morning,
April 6.</h4>
</div>



<p><span class="sc">Swift Macneill's</span> smile infectious. It illumined with something
of saintly halo the depressed figure of Dr. <span class="sc">Barton</span>, who, again
breaking his vow of silence, confessed that yesterday he had been
enrolled as Member of an Organisation in Ulster sworn to resist
Home-Rule. "I don't know, Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>," he said, in hoarse
whisper, "what that act may involve, and I don't care. It may lead
to my spending the remainder of my days in penal servitude."
Whereat the jaded House merrily laughed.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second
Reading
Home-Rule Bill
moved.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;A dull
night, my masters.
Still harping on
Home Rule. Second
night's debate on
Second Reading.
Naturally supposed
to be in heyday of
vigour. But Benches
empty; level of
oratory third-rate;
<span class="sc">Stansfeld</span> a hoary
Triton among the
Minnows; <span class="sc">Ellis
Ashmead Bartlett</span>
(Knight) gloomily
views the scene.
"Thought you were
going to speak to-night?"
I said,
"Read the announcement
in the
papers." Never forget
the haughty,
withering glance of
<span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead</span>.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said,
"I talk only with
my peers."</p>

<p>So suppose we shall
have him one day
next week, when
<span class="sc">Chamberlain,
Grandolph</span>, and
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> take part
in fray. Begins to
look as if, for all
practical purposes,
might as well have
deferred meeting of
House till Monday.</p>

<p>"Mr. G. a great man," says <span class="sc">Davitt</span>. "Insisted upon us coming
back on Thursday, to debate Home-Rule Bill. He can do most
things; he can bring a horse to the water, but he can't make him
debate."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Eight hours' talk round Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width:200px;"><a href="images/180c.png"><img src="images/180c-200.png" width="200" height="221" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Influence of Music.</span>&mdash;I recently noticed a paragraph in a
Medical Journal advising persons suffering from Insomnia to try a
musical box in their bed-rooms; and I therefore purchased a rather
expensive one, which plays six tunes,
with drum and trumpet accompaniment.
Something seems to have gone wrong with
the mechanism, as, after being fully wound
up, it remains obstinately silent for an hour
or so, at the end of which period it suddenly
starts off at break-neck speed, and
repeats one of the tunes backwards over
and over again. Nothing that I can do
will stop it. Could some musical expert
kindly advise in this case? After a most
agitated night, due to the vagaries of the
instrument, I took it into bed with me,
hoping to drown the noise; but the vibration
of the drums under the bed-clothes was terrific! I then placed
the machine in my bath, and covered it with water; but it continued
to play with undiminished vigour. It is still playing.
Some Museum, or a Government engaged in sub-marine experiments,
might like to have it; or it might be suited for a Deaf
and Dumb Asylum. It will be sold cheap.</p>

<p><span class="sc">"The Silver Shell."</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">H. J. W. Dam's</span> new Play (the
initial letters, save the name&mdash;and as to the name, <i>absit omen!</i>)
treats of Russian life. There is a "toff" in it, played by Mr. <span class="sc">Kendal</span>,
whose name is <i>Prince Karatoff</i>, which reminds us of the <i>Duke
of Turniptop</i>. Or, if he is an <i>insouciant</i> sort of person, he would
more properly be titled, <i>Prince Don't-Kar-a-toff</i>. Unfortunate
name, too, is <i>Boris Ivanitch</i>. Perhaps a Big Bore is <i>Ivanitch</i>;
and as to the family title, Ivanitch&mdash;well, considered theatrically,
it sounds unpleasantly like belonging to a scratch company.
There's a bomb in it, which, we were informed, in a <i>D. T.</i> note,
"appears as part of the furniture of a drawing-room." The entire
furniture-covering is made, we are privately informed, of "bombazine,"
and the explosion may be expected to be terrific. For
the sake of the clever Managers of the Court, not forgetting their
<span class="sc">H. J. W. Dam</span> clever author, we trust <i>The Silver Shell</i> will be,
for
many months to come, an occasion for the public to silver shell out.</p>
